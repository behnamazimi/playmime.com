## Why free + browser‑based wins

Friends bail when setup drags. A browser link means everyone can join instantly — on phones, tablets, or laptops. Words, modes and timers are built in so you spend your time laughing, not configuring.

## Choose your format

- Quick Play: short, high‑energy rounds with a scoreboard.
- One Word Per Turn: calmer pacing for mixed tech setups.
- Heads‑Up: hold the phone to your forehead — teammates shout clues.

Switch formats between rounds for a fresh feel.

## Rules that keep it smooth

- Actors don’t speak or spell; they act with gestures and expressions.
- Teammates guess out loud; 1 point per correct answer.
- 60–90 seconds per turn; allow one pass.
- Use shared gestures: number of words, “sounds like,” media icons.

Competitive: Occupations, Sports, Abstract Phrases.
