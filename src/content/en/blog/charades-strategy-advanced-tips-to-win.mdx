Charades may look chaotic, but great teams treat it like a sport. They manage time, signal clearly, and act with purpose.

## Build a shared language

Before round one, align on a few nonverbal signals:

- Fingers for number of words in a title.
- Pointing up to indicate “first word… second word…”
- Ear tug for “sounds like.”
- Outline a rectangle (screen) for “movie,” a book for “book,” a note for “song.”

These signals compress clues into seconds, especially online where crosstalk can slow guesses.

## Act in headlines, not paragraphs

Your first 3 seconds should announce the concept category: animal, action, place, person, or media. Use big, unmistakable gestures. Then zoom into distinctive traits — how it moves, where it lives, what it’s for. Think billboard, not essay.

---

## Stack clues from general to specific

Start broad (“animal”), then narrow (“big cat,” “stripes,” “jungle”). This shapes your team’s mental search tree. If they stall, switch lanes — show the environment (trees), a behavior (stalking), or a related idea (zookeeper) to re‑anchor their guesses.

---

## Use space and rhythm

Step forward for emphasis, backward to reset, and side to side to separate multi‑word phrases. Pause between ideas. The emptier your motions, the clearer your message.

---

## Train your guessers

Winning teams guess in patterns: category → size → place → action. Encourage teammates to say short, distinct guesses instead of full sentences. Assign a captain to echo the final guess so the actor can lock onto a single voice.

---

## Manage the clock

Use 60–90 seconds. If you’re 20 seconds in with no traction, pivot to easier aspects. Save your one pass for truly stuck moments. Near the end, prioritize easy wins over stubborn prompts.

---

## Practice sets to sharpen skills

Run three 5‑minute drills:

1) Animals only — focus on movement and size.  
2) Actions only — exaggerate verbs: whispering, juggling, tip‑toeing.  
3) Movies — signal number of words, then act iconic scenes.

## Online considerations

For video calls, frame from knees up, use bright front lighting, and keep the background simple. Ask non‑actors to stay quiet so the actor can hear one clear stream of guesses.

With a shared playbook and a few high‑leverage habits, your team will start cruising through prompts. Open [/play](/en/play) and put these tactics to work tonight.
