title: The Essential Charades Game Night Checklist
description: Everything you need for a flawless charades night — setup, rules, roles, playlists, and printable‑ready lists if you’re going analog.
---

Charades is a low‑prep game, but the best nights still benefit from a simple plan. Use this **charades game night checklist** to cover the basics — then add flair with themes, playlists, and funny awards. Whether you’re playing in person, online, or hybrid, these steps make hosting feel effortless.

---

## 1) Pick your format

- In‑person around one screen or device
- Fully remote on Zoom/Meet/FaceTime
- Hybrid: two rooms, one scoreboard

If you want no‑prep hosting, open [/play](/en/play) and select a mode.

---

## 2) Define light rules

- No speaking or spelling the word.
- Common gestures allowed (number of words, “sounds like,” media icons).
- 60–90 seconds per turn; 1 point per correct guess.
- One pass per round is okay; keep momentum.

Post the rules where everyone can see them or share via chat.

---

## 3) Agree on categories

- Families: Animals, Actions, Food, Places
- Friends: Pop culture, Sports, Movies & TV, Travel
- Work: Office life, Tech, Communication, Travel

If you use Playmime.com to play charades, you’ll see a category listed below the word, so you can say it out loud. 

---

## 4) Assign roles

- Host/facilitator: calls turns, keeps pace
- Scorekeeper: updates totals, announces winners
- DJ: curates the hype playlist between rounds

Roles make big groups run smoothly and give non‑actors a way to contribute.

---

## 5) Prep your space

Clear a small acting area, set up good lighting, and place the screen at eye level. For online play, ask the current actor to stand back for full‑body gestures and test microphones before round one.

---

## 6) Build the playlist

Upbeat, lyric‑light tracks keep focus on the action. Think funky instrumentals, retro pop, or movie scores. Keep it at a volume where shouted guesses are still clear.

---

## 7) Printables and backups (optional)

If you’re going analog, prepare a few slips of paper with easy prompts. But if you’d rather skip prep entirely, use PlayMime’s categories and timers.

---

## 8) Sample 30‑minute run of show

1. Welcome and rules (2 minutes)
2. Round 1: Animals (easy) (6 minutes)
3. Round 2: Occupations (medium) (6 minutes)
4. Round 3: Movies & TV (medium) (6 minutes)
5. Final round: Wildcard (hard) (6 minutes)
6. Awards and photo finish (4 minutes)

Add a silly trophy: “Most Dramatic,” “Fastest Guesser,” “Best Improviser.”

With a little structure and a lot of heart, charades becomes the highlight of your week. Open [/play](/en/play) and you’ll be acting in seconds.
