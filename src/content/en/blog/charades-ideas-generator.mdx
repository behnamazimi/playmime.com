## Dial in the difficulty

For family play, choose everyday actions and familiar animals. With adults or seasoned players, sprinkle in abstract concepts (plot twist, cliffhanger), compound phrases (undercover agent), or multi‑word titles (Back to the Future). If you’re playing competitively, set time limits between 60–90 seconds and award one point per correct guess.

## How to customize prompts for your group

- Match the age range and interests — cartoons for kids, pop culture for adults.
- Use themed nights (travel, music, sports) for an elevated experience.
- Add “no sound effects” or “no props” challenges for extra laughs.
- For large groups, split into teams and alternate actors rapidly.

With PlayMime’s built‑in word banks, you will see the categories below each word.

## Generator vs. manual lists

Manual lists are fine for small, casual sessions — but they take time, can skew difficulty, and might favor the person who wrote them. A generator offers a neutral, always‑ready source of prompts that scales from 3 to 30 players with no extra work.
