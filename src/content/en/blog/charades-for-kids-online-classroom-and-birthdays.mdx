## Why it works for kids

Charades encourages expressive movement and social confidence. The rules are simple, the turns are short, and every player gets a moment to shine. Plus, kids love guessing together — it’s collaborative without the pressure of long speeches or perfect answers.

## Set up in 3 minutes

- Share a video call link or gather in one room with a big screen.
- Explain the rules in one sentence: “Act without speaking, guess out loud.”
- Choose a category like Animals or Actions.
- Start with 45–60 second turns to keep the pace brisk.

If you’re remote, remind actors to stand far enough back for full‑body gestures, and keep microphones unmuted during guessing.

Use clear floorspace and encourage gentle movements. Offer non‑acting roles (scorekeeper, emcee) and avoid prompts that require jumping or crouching if mobility is a concern. In remote settings, ensure chat is friendly and moderated.

Charades for kids online is a reliably joyful format. With simple prompts and short rounds, you’ll create a screen‑time moment that’s active, social, and full of laughter.
