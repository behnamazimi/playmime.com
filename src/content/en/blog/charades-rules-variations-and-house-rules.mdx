No matter where you play, **charades rules** share the same heartbeat: act without speaking, guess as a team, and beat the clock. From there, the magic is in your house rules. This guide covers the classic format, common gestures, and fresh variations that keep game night lively for families, friends, and remote teams.

## Classic rules (the baseline)

- No speaking, mouthing, writing, or spelling the secret word.
- Use pantomime only: gestures, facial expressions, and movement.
- Teammates shout guesses; 1 point per correct answer.
- 60–90 second turns; alternate teams each round.

---

## Shared gestures

- Number of words: hold up fingers to indicate how many.
- Word order: point up for “first word,” then act it.
- Media icons: book (book), rectangle (movie), musical note (song).
- “Sounds like”: gentle ear tug, then act the rhyming word.

Agree on these at the start so everyone is on the same page.

## Popular house rules

- One pass per turn: keeps momentum when a prompt is a bad fit.
- Bonus for streaks: +1 for every 3 consecutive correct guesses.
- Spotlight swap: the opposing team chooses your next actor.
- Mirror mode: actors must mirror a teammate’s gestures.
- One‑hand round: adds fun constraint without confusion.

Use 1–2 twists per night; too many rules slow the game.

## Competitive variations

- Sudden death: one hard prompt, first team to guess wins.
- Lightning tag: two actors tag in mid‑round; nonstop prompts.
- Captain’s draft: captains pick the next actor.
