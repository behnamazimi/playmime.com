The secret to a great first game night is simple: pick **easy charades words** that everyone recognizes. When your prompts are friendly and familiar, kids feel confident, adults get silly, and the whole room stays engaged. Consider this your go‑to starter list — plus tips for choosing the right difficulty and keeping things fair.

## How to choose the right difficulty

Aim for words that can be acted with big, clear gestures — no complex vocabulary or niche references. Keep rounds short (60–75 seconds), and mix categories so every player finds their groove.

If you want to skip prep, use PlayMime’s family‑friendly words in [/play](/en/play).

## Sample 10‑minute family session

1. Open [/play](/en/play) and select Quick Play.
2. Choose words easy and categories (Animals or Actions).
3. 60 seconds per turn; rotate actors every round.
4. Give one hint gesture (number of words, “sounds like”) if needed.
5. End with a goofy victory pose for the winning team.

Easy words make charades welcoming and laughter‑filled. When you’re ready, increase the challenge with medium prompts or themed nights. Until then, keep it simple — and playful.
