### Captain’s Draft

Team captains alternate picking either the next category or the next actor. Adds playful strategy and gives quieter players a highlight turn.

### Sudden‑Death Overtime

Tied after regulation? One hard prompt, one actor per team. First correct guess wins the night. Cue the music.

## Add tasteful twists

- No sound effects allowed.
- One‑hand acting only.
- Mirror mode: Actor must mirror a teammate’s gestures.
- Rhyme time: Clue givers can only use rhyming hints in heads‑up rounds.

These constraints ignite creativity and memorable fails — the good kind.

## Hosting tips that keep momentum

Use 60–90 second rounds, rotate actors quickly, and avoid long explanations between turns. Encourage bold, exaggerated movement and let teams celebrate big wins. If a prompt stalls, allow a single pass and keep it moving.

Whether your crew is two apartments or twenty cities apart, online charades turns a regular Friday into a story you’ll retell for weeks. Fire up the room with a Quick Play round at [/play](/en/play) and let the hype take over.

## Pro hosting moves

- Keep a short hype playlist ready for transitions.
- Rotate first actors each round so everyone gets a spotlight moment.
- Save one hard prompt for a dramatic finale.
- Capture a “champions screenshot” at the end — memories matter as much as scores.
