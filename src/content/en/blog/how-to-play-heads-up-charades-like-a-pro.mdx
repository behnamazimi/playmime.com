Heads‑up charades turns guessing into a spectacle: one player holds the screen to their forehead while everyone else shouts clues. It’s high‑energy, wonderfully chaotic, and a guaranteed crowd‑pleaser for parties, classrooms, and video calls. If you’ve tried it and felt overwhelmed, this guide will teach you crisp strategies, universal gestures, and smooth facilitation so every round feels fast and fair.

You can jump into a heads‑up mode in seconds at [/play](/en/play).

## The core loop

1. Actor holds the device to their forehead so only the audience sees the word.
2. Teammates give verbal clues (no acting from them), avoiding any part of the word.
3. The actor guesses; correct answers score a point, and the next word appears.
4. Keep going until the timer ends; tally points for the round.

Unlike classic charades, the actor is guessing from teammates’ spoken hints, so clarity and pace matter more than pantomime.

## Make clues short and visual

Great clues paint a picture in one or two words. Aim for:

- Category anchors: “Animal,” “Movie,” “Sport.”
- Visual verbs: “Flying,” “Sliding,” “Whispering.”
- Distinguishing traits: “Striped,” “Round,” “Spiky.”

Avoid long sentences or synonyms of the secret word. If you’re stuck, describe what the thing does (function) or where you’d find it (context).

## Train your guesser’s ear

As the actor, you’re not just guessing — you’re pattern‑matching under pressure. Improve by:

- Echoing back the category first: “Okay, animal… big? small?”
- Asking for contrasts: “Not a cat — bigger? Jungle? Water?”
- Using elimination: If teammates say “black and white” and “slides on ice,” think penguin fast.

These micro‑dialogues compress the search space and speed up correct guesses.

## Pace the round like a conductor

The facilitator’s job is to maintain rhythm. Keep rounds at 60–90 seconds, rotate guessers quickly, and celebrate each correct answer with a snap of energy — clapping, sound effects, or a quick “next!” That momentum is what makes heads‑up charades feel electric.

---

## Gestures that help (even in heads‑up)

Although guessers don’t act, the audience can still use agreed‑upon signals between clues:

- Fingers for number of words in a title.
- Ear tug for “sounds like…”.
- Book/movie/song icons for media types.

Establish these at the start so your team speaks a shared visual language.

## Avoid common pitfalls

**Pitfall: Over‑describing.**  
Solution: Keep hints short. Use one vivid trait at a time.

**Pitfall: Accidentally saying the word.**  
Solution: Describe function, category, and context — not syllables or rhymes that reveal it.

**Pitfall: Talking over each other on video calls.**  
Solution: Assign a clue captain who leads with the first hint, and others follow.

**Pitfall: Stalled momentum.**  
Solution: Shorter rounds, quicker passes, and high‑energy transitions.

## Heads‑up troubleshooting

**Too much crosstalk?** Assign a clue captain. Others add one‑word hints between guesses.

**Guessers freeze?** Offer category anchors first, then one vivid trait.

**Actor overwhelmed?** Allow a single pass per round and shorten the timer to 60 seconds.

**Internet lag?** Keep cameras on but ask non‑speakers to mute briefly.
