The perfect video call doesn’t need slides — it needs a reason to smile. **Charades on Zoom, Google Meet, or FaceTime** brings real‑world energy to screens with almost no setup. This guide shows you how to frame your camera, manage audio, pick the right mode, and facilitate like a pro so every call feels like a reunion.

## Fast setup checklist

- Share a link to your call and ask participants to join from a well‑lit space.
- Encourage laptop or tablet over phones for wider camera angles.
- Test microphones quickly; ask players to keep them unmuted during guessing.
- Open [/play](/en/play) in a browser and choose a mode.

## Camera and space tips

- Frame from knees up so gestures read clearly.
- Clear a small area; avoid tripping hazards.
- Use indirect light from in front of you, not behind.
- If space is tight, exaggerate facial expressions and upper‑body gestures.

## Modes that work best online

- **Quick Play**: Snappy rounds with a shared scoreboard.
- **One Word Per Turn**: Slower pace for mixed tech setups.
- **Heads‑Up**: Great for big laughs — just keep clue givers from talking over each other.

Set the timer to 60–90 seconds and rotate actors swiftly to keep attention high.

## Facilitation 101

- Appoint a host to call the order and confirm scores.
- Establish visual signals: fingers for number of words, ear tug for “sounds like.”
- Allow one pass per turn if a prompt stalls.

---

## Word sets for video calls

Choose inclusive, high‑imagination prompts:

- Actions: Whispering, Tip‑toeing, Juggling, Sledding
- Places: Airport, Library, Amusement park, Subway
- Occupations: Lifeguard, Barista, Detective, Astronaut
- Abstract: Plot twist, Time machine, Cliffhanger, Mind blown

Or skip curation and rely on PlayMime’s built‑in word banks.

## Common hiccups — and quick fixes

Echo or lag? Ask non‑actors to briefly mute.  
Camera too close? Tilt the screen back or step away.  
People talking over each other? Name a clue captain to lead the hints.  
Energy dip? Shorten rounds and play a hype song between turns.

With a few small tweaks, your regular call becomes a highlight of the week. Send the link, open [/play](/en/play), and start your first round.
