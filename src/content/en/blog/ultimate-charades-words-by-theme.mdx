## Build your own sets

To create custom word banks, start with people’s interests. For example, a travel‑loving group can play “Around the World,” with prompts like train station, passport control, street market, and mountain hike. Music lovers can pull from instruments (drums, violin), events (music festival), and roles (sound engineer).

Rotate the theme every round and let the current actor choose from two prompts if nerves kick in. The aim is momentum and laughter, not perfection.

---

## Quick formats for any group

- Family night: Animals → Actions → Food (easy)
- Friends party: Pop culture → Sports → Movies (mixed)
- Remote team: Office life → Travel → Actions (inclusive)

End with a “Wildcard” round where actors can pick any theme. It’s the perfect finale.
