Remote teams thrive on moments of shared play. Done well, **online charades** becomes a low‑stakes ritual that builds trust and renews energy. This toolkit gives you a plug‑and‑play agenda, inclusive word sets, and facilitation scripts you can drop into your next stand‑up, all‑hands, or social hour.

## Agenda templates

### 10‑minute energizer

- 1 min: Welcome and rules (no speaking, use gestures, 60‑second turns)
- 6 min: Two rounds, easy categories (Actions, Animals)
- 2 min: Shout‑outs (most creative, funniest moment)
- 1 min: Transition back to work

### 20‑minute team showdown

- 2 min: Rules + house signals
- 15 min: Three rounds (Actions → Occupations → Movies)
- 3 min: Debrief: “What helped you guess faster?”

---

## Inclusive prompt sets

- Actions: Whispering, Tip‑toeing, Juggling, Sledding, Zoom wave
- Office life: Daily stand‑up, Coffee break, Brainstorming, Deadline, Whiteboard
- Tech & comms: Screenshot, Calendar invite, Muted microphone, Wi‑Fi signal, Emoji

Avoid niche pop culture. Favor universal, workplace‑safe prompts.

## Facilitation scripts

“We’ll play for 60 seconds per turn. Act without speaking; teammates guess out loud. Use our shared signals: fingers for number of words, ear tug for ‘sounds like.’ One pass allowed per turn.”

“Captains, please call your next actor in chat. Everyone else, cheer loudly when you hear a correct guess.”

---

## Accessibility & inclusion

- Encourage seated‑friendly acting where needed.
- Offer non‑acting roles (scorekeeper, emcee).
- Keep cameras on but allow audio‑only for comfort.

Start small, keep it joyful, and repeat monthly. Consistency beats extravagance. Open [/play](/en/play) to run your first energizer today.
