## The fast tech setup

- Use Zoom, Google Meet, or FaceTime.
- Ask players to join from well‑lit spaces with enough room for hand gestures.
- Encourage laptops or tablets for wider camera angles.
- Soundcheck: unmute during guessing; mute briefly during transitions.

---

## Pick your mode (and why)

- Quick Play: best balance of speed and clarity; ideal for mixed groups.
- One Word Per Turn: calmer, strategic, and great for first‑timers.
- Heads‑Up: chaotic and hilarious; perfect after everyone warms up.

Switch modes between rounds to keep the night fresh.

## House rules that travel well

- No talking or spelling the word by the actor.
- Shared gestures: number of words, “sounds like,” media icons.
- 60–90 seconds per turn; 1 point per correct guess.
- One pass allowed per turn if you truly stall.

Consistency helps friends who haven’t played in a while dive back in.

## Word ideas by vibe

Chill night: Animals, Actions, Food & Treats.  
Competitive: Occupations, Sports & Fitness, Abstract Phrases.  
Nostalgia: Movies & TV, ‘90s pop culture, Travel memories.
