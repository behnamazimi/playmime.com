## What Is Charades?

Charades is a guessing game where one person acts out a word or phrase without speaking, while their team tries to guess what it is. The goal? Get as many correct guesses as possible before the timer runs out.

## What You Need to Play Charades

You don’t need much to play charades:

- Slips of paper or a charades app with words/phrases
- At least 4 players (more is better)

## Step-by-Step Rules for Playing Charades

### 1. **Split Into Two Teams**
Divide players into two teams. Each team will take turns sending one person up to act while the rest guess.

### 2. **Prepare the Words or Phrases**
You can write ideas on paper and put them in a bowl, or use a charades app. Keep the words age-appropriate and themed if you like (movies, animals, sports, etc.).

**Tip:** Start with easy, familiar words if you're playing with beginners or kids.

### 3. **Choose the First Actor**
One team starts by choosing a player to act out the first word. That player draws a word or phrase without showing it to anyone.

### 4. **Set the Timer**
Start the timer — usually 1 to 2 minutes is plenty. While the timer runs, the actor tries to get their team to guess the word **without speaking or mouthing words**.

### 5. **Use Only Gestures and Body Language**
The actor can’t talk, make sounds, or point to objects in the room. They must act using body language, gestures, and facial expressions only.

### 6. **Guess Until Time’s Up**
The team can shout out guesses until they get it right or the time runs out. If they guess correctly in time, they score a point.

### 7. **Switch Teams**
After one round, the other team takes their turn. Keep alternating until all the words are used or for a set number of rounds.

## Basic Charades Gesture Tips

Actors often use these signals to help their team:

- **“It’s a book/movie/song”** – pretend to open a book, roll a film, or play music.
- **“Sounds like…”** – tug on your earlobe to hint at a rhyming word.
- **“Number of words”** – show fingers to signal how many words in the phrase.
- **“First word, second word…”** – point up to start acting each word.
