Nothing beats the moment when a friend nails a ridiculous guess with one second left on the clock. With **multiplayer charades online**, you can create that energy anytime — no cleanup, no prep, just pure laughter.

Here’s a simple blueprint to get you playing in minutes.

---

## What you’ll need

- A video call or a shared room in a charades app
- A timer (built into most platforms)
- Willingness to look a little silly

PlayMime bundles everything in one place — open [/play](/en/play) and pick a mode.

---

## Choose a mode that fits your group

- **Quick Play**: Race to rack up points in short rounds.
- **One Word Per Turn**: Slower pace and more strategy; ideal for mixed ages.
- **Heads‑Up**: Hold the device to your forehead while others give clues.

Each mode revolves around the same core rule: act silently, guess loudly.

---

## House rules to agree on

- No speaking, mouthing, writing, or pointing to words on the screen.
- Use common gestures: number of words, “sounds like,” book/movie/song icons.
- 60–90 seconds per turn; 1 point per correct guess.

Add optional twists like “no sound effects” or category locks for extra challenge.

---

## Smooth remote play setup

- Ask the current actor to stand back so their hands are visible.
- Encourage exaggerated expressions and full‑body acting.
- Keep turns snappy — momentum is your best friend.

---

## Word ideas by difficulty

Start easy, then elevate:

- Easy: Pizza, Airplane, Cat, Dancing, Firefighter
- Medium: Detective, Roller coaster, Time machine, Marathon
- Hard: Cliffhanger, Plot twist, Undercover agent, Documentary

Or let PlayMime supply endless prompts so you can focus on performing.

---

## Keep the fun going

- Rotate first actors each round to share the spotlight.
- Celebrate hilarious fails and near misses — they’re half the joy.
- Try theme nights (sports, ‘90s, travel) to change the flavor.

When you’re ready, send the invite, open [/play](/en/play), and start your first multiplayer charades session. Your friends will thank you for the easiest, most joyful game night they’ve had all week.
