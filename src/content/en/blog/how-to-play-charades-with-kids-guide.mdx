## How to Play Charades with Kids

### 1. **Pick a Word or Clue**
Choose a simple word or phrase. For younger children, you can whisper the word or show a picture instead of using written prompts.

You can prepare your own word cards or use Playmime to generate ideas instantly.

### 2. **Act It Out—Without Talking**
The child acts out the word using body movements and facial expressions. No speaking, mouthing words, or pointing at objects.

### 3. **Make a Guess**
The other players try to guess what the word is. Give about one to two minutes per turn. If no one guesses it, offer a hint or move on to the next player.

### 4. **Take Turns**
Once the round ends, switch roles. Keep the pace quick and let everyone have a turn to act and guess.
