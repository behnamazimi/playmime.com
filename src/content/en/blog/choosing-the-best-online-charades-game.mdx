## What actually matters in an online charades game

### 1) Zero‑friction start

No downloads. No accounts. The best games launch in the browser with one click. If you’re bringing together kids, grandparents, and coworkers, even a small setup bump can drain energy before the first laugh.

### 2) Thoughtful word banks

Look for broad categories (Animals, Actions, Movies, Sports, Office Life) and tunable difficulty. You want inclusive, universal prompts for mixed groups — and the option to go harder with abstract phrases when your crowd gets competitive.

### 3) Flexible game modes

Different vibes require different modes:

- Quick Play: Fast rounds with a shared scoreboard.
- One Word Per Turn: Slower, strategic turns for clarity.
- Heads‑Up: Actor holds the device to the forehead; teammates give clues.
- Random Word Generator: Practice mode or party warm‑up.

### 4) Fair timers and scoring

You should be able to set 60–90 second turns, allow a single pass, and award 1 point per correct guess. A visible timer and minimal clicks between prompts keep momentum high.

### 5) Mobile and desktop friendly

The interface must be readable from across a living room and usable on a phone at arm’s length. Big buttons, high‑contrast text, and responsive layouts matter more than fancy animations.

### 6) Accessibility and inclusion

Features that help: seated‑friendly acting suggestions, and low‑motion UI. Offer roles beyond acting (scorekeeper, emcee) so everyone participates comfortably.

## The modes you’ll actually use

If you host regularly, you’ll rotate between three modes.

1) Quick Play: Your go‑to for friends and families. It rewards momentum.

2) One Word Per Turn: Best for classroom or team sessions. It keeps crosstalk down on video calls and makes each guess feel like a small win.

3) Heads‑Up: The crowd‑pleaser. It’s chaotic and loud in the best way. Use it after people are warmed up.

All of these are available in [/play](/en/play); try one round of each to sense your group’s preference.

## How to evaluate word quality (in 60 seconds)

Think about a category and scan 10 prompts. Ask:

- Are there obvious gestures for most words?
- Is there a mix of concrete nouns and dynamic actions?
- Do any prompts feel too niche or regional for your group?
- Is there a visible path to escalate difficulty (e.g., abstract ideas, multi‑word titles)?

If yes across the board, you’ve got a winner.

## The one‑minute setup plan

1. Share a call link (Zoom/Meet/FaceTime) or gather around a single screen.
2. Open [/play](/en/play) and select Quick Play.
3. Set 60–90 seconds per turn; allow one pass.
4. Explain two gestures: number of words (fingers) and “sounds like” (ear tug).
5. Start with Animals or Actions; increase difficulty each round.

This plan works for 3–30 players with no extra prep.

## Common pitfalls and fixes

Pitfall: People talk over each other on calls.  
Fix: Assign a clue captain who leads hints; others add short traits.

Pitfall: Actors freeze.  
Fix: Encourage “headline acting” — category first, then one bold trait.

Pitfall: Rounds drag or feel chaotic.  
Fix: Shorten the timer, rotate actors quickly, and keep transitions snappy.
