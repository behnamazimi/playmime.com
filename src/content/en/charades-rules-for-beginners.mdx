## What Is Charades?

Charades is a guessing game where one person acts out a word or phrase without speaking, while their team tries to guess what it is. The goal? Get as many correct guesses as possible before the timer runs out.

You don’t need much to play charades:

## Step-by-Step Rules for Playing Charades

### 1. **Split Into Two Teams**
Divide players into two teams. Each team will take turns sending one person up to act while the rest guess.

### 2. **Prepare the Words or Phrases**
You can write ideas on paper and put them in a bowl, or use a charades app. Keep the words age-appropriate and themed if you like (movies, animals, sports, etc.).

**Tip:** Start with easy, familiar words if you're playing with beginners or kids.

### 3. **Choose the First Actor**
One team starts by choosing a player to act out the first word. That player draws a word or phrase without showing it to anyone.

### 4. **Set the Timer**
Start the timer—usually 1 to 2 minutes is plenty. While the timer runs, the actor tries to get their team to guess the word **without speaking or mouthing words**.

### 5. **Use Only Gestures and Body Language**
The actor can’t talk, make sounds, or point to objects in the room. They must act using body language, gestures, and facial expressions only.

### 6. **Guess Until Time’s Up**
The team can shout out guesses until they get it right or the time runs out. If they guess correctly in time, they score a point.

### 7. **Switch Teams**
After one round, the other team takes their turn. Keep alternating until all the words are used or for a set number of rounds.

## Basic Charades Gesture Tips

Actors often use these signals to help their team:

- **“It’s a book/movie/song”** – pretend to open a book, roll a film, or play music.
- **“Sounds like…”** – tug on your earlobe to hint at a rhyming word.
- **“Number of words”** – show fingers to signal how many words in the phrase.
- **“First word, second word…”** – point up to start acting each word.
