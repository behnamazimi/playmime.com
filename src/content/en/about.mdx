description: Discover the story behind Playmime and why we created it.
---

Playmime began as a small weekend project, born out of a simple idea: to make charades more fun and accessible during
the parties and game nights. We wanted something that you can use to create unforgettable memoriesâ€”all without
the hassle of finding pen, paper, or installing a specific app to get a list of cool words.

At the best part, itâ€™s completely free. No subscriptions, no paywallsâ€”just pure, unfiltered fun for everyone.

### Built for the Community

Playmime isnâ€™t just a tool; itâ€™s a community-driven project. We made it open-source so everyone can contribute
to making it even better. Whether you're fixing bugs, suggesting new features, or adding words in your language,
every contribution helps.

Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:
- **Expand Word Lists:** Add fresh ideas for charades players around the world for existing languages.
- **Support New Languages:** Introduce a whole new language to the platform and help players from different cultures connect.
- **Suggest Features:** Share your ideas for new features that could make Playmime even more fun and engaging.
- **Fix Bugs:** Help us identify and fix any issues that might be affecting the Playmime experience.

Together, we can make Playmime a go-to tool for charades enthusiasts everywhere.
