description: Discover the story behind Playmime and why we created it.

Playmime began as a small weekend project, born out of a simple idea: to make charades more fun for our friends and
family during the parties and game nights. We wanted something that could bring everyone together, spark laughter,
and create unforgettable memoriesâ€”all without the hassle of finding pen, paper, or **the perfect word list**.

At its core, Playmime is all about simplicity and connection. We designed it to be as straightforward as possible so
that anyone, anywhere, could jump right in and start acting out. And the best part? Itâ€™s completely free.
No subscriptions, no paywallsâ€”just pure, unfiltered fun for everyone.

But we didnâ€™t stop there. We wanted Playmime to be more than just a game; we wanted it to be a community. Thatâ€™s why
**[itâ€™s open-source](https://github.com/behnamazimi/playmime)**. Anyone can contribute to the project, whether by
adding features, fixing bugs, adding or tweaking words for their language, or even introducing a whole new language.
Itâ€™s a platform built to grow with the creativity and passion of its players around the world.

Our goal has always been to make Playmime accessible to everyone, everywhere, no matter who you are or where youâ€™re
from. Whether youâ€™re hosting a cozy family night or connecting with friends across the globe, we hope Playmime adds
a little extra joy to your moments together.

So, grab your friends, pick a game mode, and let the fun begin. After all, the best memories are made when weâ€™re
laughing, guessing, and working together.

Thanks for letting Playmime be a part of your story. Letâ€™s keep playingâ€”and keep smilingâ€”together. ðŸ’›
